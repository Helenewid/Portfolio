        <h2>01 Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project was an assignment given to me through school. The client, The Dutch Foundation of Mobile Heritage (MCN) wanted to increase the visibility and accessibility of the experiential knowledge held by the mobile heritage amateurs, club members, and volunteers. This was a group project. <br><br>
I was tasked with designing a concept that highlights and shares the unique skills and knowledge of these individuals, promoting knowledge transfer to new generations and connecting with other communities. The design needed to be user-friendly and not impose extra work on the community members. 
<br><br>
The client wanted us to do research into how to get the knowledge from the community members and how to showcase it in the best, and most interesting way. We did the research through observations, interviews and desk research. The client had an empty building that they wanted us to redesign, making into a community hub welcoming for everyone. 

At the end of the project, the client got a research report, design report and a final walkthrough video of our concept for the empty space.

              <h3>1. Research</h3>
              <p>
                The research we conducted focused on both the area surrounding Loods M, the history of the area, the people who would visit the exhibition, as well as the mobile heritage amateurs and club members.
                <br> We focused on interviewing the members of the mobile heritage clubs, to get more and better insights into their stories and information they would be able to teach the people visiting Loods M.

              <h3>2. Ideation</h3>
              <p>
                Our group went through a long ideation phase, where we created multiple ideas and sketches of a final concept, and even went as far as to try out some of them to see how they would work within Loods M. We also worked with the two personas we were given from the client, keeping them in mind.
                <br><br> In the end, we decided, together with the client, to create a mix of three concepts, which we then worked on to create a final concept.

              <h3>3. Prototyping</h3>
              <p>
                Because the concept was a physical exhibition, we first started prototyping with the building in Loods M in mind. We decided to create the building and the inside of it in 3D, so we could ''physically'' put our concepts inside the building.
